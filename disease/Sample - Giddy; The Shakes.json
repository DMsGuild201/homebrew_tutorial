				"These involuntary tremors can have many causes, but are most often brought about when a creature goes a long period without drinking alcohol.",
				"Symptoms manifest around an hour after the last time the afflicted creature had a drink. The onset of the symptoms is usually accompanied by escalating complaints from the individual, starting with a relatively harmless \"gosh, I'm parched. Anyone else fancy a drink?\" and moving swiftly through \"do you know any pubs around here? I don't mind if it's a bit of a dive\" to \"I swear to Moradin I'd kill for a stein right now. Hey, what're you hiding there?\" During this process, the creature will have trouble concentrating on anything, and their hands will be visibly shaking.",
				"Thereafter, for every hour during which the afflicted creature fails to find and consume an alcoholic beverage, they suffer a cumulative -2 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks, to a maximum of -10. Additionally, suffer the effects of the {@condition poisoned} condition. Should the afflicted creature consume alcohol, the symptoms clear within minutes, and are suppressed for the next hour. Should the creature fail to consume alcohol, the symptoms instead worsen. At around 24 hours from the last time the creature had a drink, they begin to experience intense withdrawal, and gain three levels of exhaustion.",
				"Should the creature wish to cure themselves of this disease, they need only refrain from consuming alcohol for {@dice 1d4+2} days. "
