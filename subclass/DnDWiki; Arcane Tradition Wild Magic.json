				"This spell is similar in effect to wildstrike and wildzone. When cast, a wall of faint, multi-colored lights springs into existence at the point indicated by the caster. These lights form a line 150 feet long. After the first round of the spell, the wizard can move the wall of lights. Each round, the caster can move the wall in the same direction or as much as 45 degrees to either side. Once the wall is set in motion, it cannot be stopped unless the spell is cancelled or dispelled. The lights can move 60 feet per round.",

Second, any spellcaster struck while concentrating or casting a spell automatically triggers a wild surge (use {@table Wild Magic 2|wldm|Table 2}). Magical items that expend charges that touch the wall of lights automatically release one charge at the casting and again if the Magic item remains during at then end of its wielder's turn or whenever they come into contact again, also resulting in a wild surge."
