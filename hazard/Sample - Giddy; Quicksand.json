				"A natural phenomenon, quicksand is like regular sand, but weaponized. Any creature unlucky enough to wander into a pool of quicksand is restrained. If the creature has a handhold to pull themselves out with, they may use an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, they pull themselves free, and must expend movement to leave the quicksand. Another creature may instead pull a trapped creature out, provided they are not stuck within the quicksand themselves. The DC to do so is the same.",
				"If a creature is well-versed in the ways of nature's deadliest sand variety, they may opt to drop prone to float on the quicksand. If they do so, they are no longer restrained, and may move through the quicksand, provided they remain prone. While prone, Each foot of movement through the quicksand costs 5 feet of movement."
