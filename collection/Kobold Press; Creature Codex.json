Blood mages are often found allied with or creating crimson tusked ogres (see page 279) and blood zombies (see page 393), and are on good terms with most vampires, liches, and followers of Marena, the Red Goddess. When using the Midgard setting, change the blood mage's spells to the following (see \"Fifth Edition Appendix\" in the Midgard Worldbook):",
							"Cantrips (at will): acid splash, blood tide*, mage hand, mending, prestidigitation",
							"1st level (4 slots): charm person, false life, stanch*,  weapon of blood*",
							"2nd level (3 slots): bloodshot*, hold person",
							"3rd level (3 slots): blood armor*, dispel magic, fly,  vampiric touch",
							"4th level (3 slots): black tentacles, blight",
							"5th level (2 slots): sanguine horror*, scrying"

Each time a creature targets Reynard with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets the duplicate. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack hits and destroys the duplicate. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine which Reynard is real. On a success, the creature identifies the illusion. The duplicate is intangible, but otherwise is identical to Reynard by sight, smell, or hearing. The duplicate lasts for 1 minute or until Reynard uses this lair action again."
